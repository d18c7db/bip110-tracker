## ⚖️ About BIP110: Protecting Bitcoin's Purpose
BIP110 proposes to temporarily limit the size of data fields at the consensus level. The goal is to:
* **Correct Distorted Incentives**: Address issues caused by the standardization of support for arbitrary data.
* **Refocus Priorities**: Ensure the development and resources of the network remain focused on improving Bitcoin as a global, decentralized monetary system.

## 🛠️ Project Architecture
This tracker operates entirely on GitHub's infrastructure:

1.  **Data Collection**: A GitHub Action triggers a Python script (`bip110-tracker.py`) every hour.
2.  **Network Snapshot**: The script queries [Bitnodes.io](https://bitnodes.io/) specifically for nodes signaling support for the BIP110 proposal.
3.  **Flat-File Database**: New data points (timestamp, node count, and network percentage) are appended to `data.csv`.
4.  **Frontend**: A static page using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) renders the historical trend, pulling data directly from the CSV.
